How to check climate change using data for your location

## Original data

## get_ghcn_data
The script that downloads climate data for given year and given meteorological station.
Before using this script dataset directory must been set:
```
DATADIR=/path/to/dataset/directory
export DATADIR
```
If DATADIR directory is not set, the script uses current directory as dataset directory.

```
./get_ghcn_data station_id type year1 year2
```
where:

*station_id* - station identification number (https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt)

*type* - data type, e. g. TAVG - average temperature

*year1* - starting year
